# A Debugger for Rakudo

This is an interactive, command-line debugger for Rakudo Perl 6. The easiest
ways to get hold of it are:

* By installing a recent Rakudo Star distribution
* By installing it with panda (panda install Rakudo::Debugger)

To use it, just run your script with perl6-debug rather than perl6. It takes
the same set of options as the normal perl6 executable, such as -I and -M.

For information on available commands, type h then hit enter for the help
screen once you're in the debugger. You may also like to see:
